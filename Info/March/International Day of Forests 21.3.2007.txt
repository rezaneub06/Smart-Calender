The International Day of Forests was established on the 21st day of March,
 by resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on November 28, 2012.[1] Each year, 
various events celebrate and raise awareness of the importance of all types of forests, 
and trees outside forests, for the benefit of current and future generations.[2][3]
 Countries are encouraged to undertake efforts to organize local, national, and international 
activities involving forests and trees, such as tree planting campaigns, on International Day of Forests.
 The Secretariat of the United Nations Forum on Forests, in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization, 
facilitates the implementation of such events in collaboration with governments, the Collaborative Partnership on Forests,
 and international, regional and subregional organizations.[4] International Day of Forests was observed for the
 first time on March 21, 2013
The inaugural Forest Day was one of the major events at United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) 13 in Bali, Indonesia on 7 December 2007. 
More than 800 people participated in Forest Day, including scientists, members of national delegations,
 and representatives from intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations
