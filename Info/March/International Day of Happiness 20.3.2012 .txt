The International Day of Happiness was introduced by the General Assembly of the
 United Nations during 2012 and was celebrated for the first time in 2013.
 Through seminars and educational tips and tools, the aim is to educate and increase
 public awareness of the benefits of happiness.

The original idea came from the Kingdom of Bhutan in the Himalayan region of Asia.
 There, the population is thought by many to be among the happiest in the world due to 
the holistic approach to life and the amount of importance which is placed on the well being of people and communities,
 as much as material wealth.

For everyone, the day is a useful reminder that in general happiness does not necessarily
come from buying and consuming, or from being famous or glamorous – but often from friends,
family and emotional well being. Internationally, there are many events and websites in which people may participate.
