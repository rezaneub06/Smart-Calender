On March 26, the People's Republic of Bangladesh celebrates its Independence Day.
 It is the country's national holiday that commemorates the declaration of independence of Bangladesh in 1971.
The territory of present-day Bangladesh was once part of the British India.
 After the partition of India in 1947, the region became East Pakistan within the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan.
 East Pakistan was populated mainly by the Bengali people who sought autonomy.

The independence of Bangladesh was formally declared on March 26, 1971 by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,
 who later became the country's first president. However, the country became fully independent once the Bangladesh 
Liberation War ended on December 16, 1971. The anniversaries of both events – the proclamation of independence and
 end of the war – were declared public holidays.

Traditionally, Independence Day in Bangladesh starts with a 31-gun salute. 
The celebrations typically include political speeches, ceremonies, parades, concerts, 
and a wide range of other public and private events that celebrates the country's history and traditions. 
The main streets of cities and towns are decorated with national flags. On the eve of the holiday, 
the Independence Day Award is presented.
The Independence Day of Bangladesh (Bengali: ????????? ???? Shwadhinata Dibôsh), also referred as 26 March is a national holiday.
 It commemorates the country’s declaration of independence from Pakistan on late hours of 25 March 1971. 
The day is a memorial to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians who died in the subsequent Bangladesh 
Liberation War.
