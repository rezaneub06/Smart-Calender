Annually held on January 26,
International Customs Day (ICD) recognizes the role of custom officials and agencies in maintaining border 
security. It focuses on the working conditions and challenges that customs officers face in their jobs.

Custom agencies hold employee appreciation events where custom officers are recognized for their exemplary
service. Workshops, conferences and talks that focus on the year’s theme and the challenges that agencies
and officers face are also held.
