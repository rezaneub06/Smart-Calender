Carbon dioxide emissions, primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, have risen dramatically 
since the start of the industrial revolution. Most of the world’s greenhouse gas  emissions come from a relatively 
small number of countries. China, the United States, and the nations that make up the European Union are the three
largest emitters on an absolute basis. Per capita greenhouse gas emissions are highest in the United States and Russia.
