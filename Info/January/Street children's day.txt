International Street Children’s Day is observed on 31st January every year to spread the awareness among 
the general people to stand up jointly for the rights and welfare of street children.
Street children is a term used for poor and homeless children under 18 years of age, 
living in the streets of a village, town or city. They spend their lives on the streets and start 
facing every sort of hardships in their very early stage of life. They even don’t have the very basic
 necessities of life for livelihood.
