The first origins of the English Language can be found in medieval England and takes its name from the Angles.
 The Angles were a West Germanic tribe that found its way to England, taking their name from the Anglia peninsula 
that juts out into the Baltic Sea. From its inception, it has taken on grammar, tones, and words from every language 
it has come into contact with. There are those who would 
argue that English is no longer a language of its own, but an amalgam of every language it’s come into contact with.

So powerful has English become, that it is now the Lingua Franca of the entire world, 
bringing together everyone for trade and communication, and serving as a required second language in almost every nation.
 English has become the official language of nearly 60 countries throughout the world, and it seems to gain ground with
 every passing year.

However, it also stands as one of the most complicated languages to learn as a second language (with Japanese standing 
toe to toe with it for this inauspicious award). Unsurprising when it contains words like their, there, and they’re.
 Or when the plural of goose is geese, but the plural of moose is… moose. English Language Day celebrates its history,
 its future, and its strangeness.
