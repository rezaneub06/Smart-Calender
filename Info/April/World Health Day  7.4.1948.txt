to address global health concerns, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
was established on April 7th, 1948. That year, the WHO held its first assembly for its 55 member states. 
It was at that assembly that it was determined that World Health Day would occur every year on April 7th. 
This date was chosen to commemorate the day the World Health Organization was established.

The WHO commemorates World Health Day by bringing attention to this day’s current theme.
 For instance, in 2016, the WHO released its global report on diabetes – which was the theme of that year.
 They also bring attention to the theme through print and television media and through social networks.

and to bring attention to various health conditions that affect human beings all over the world. They do this through 
activism, gallery exhibitions and lectures. People also donate time and money to the charities which are working hard
