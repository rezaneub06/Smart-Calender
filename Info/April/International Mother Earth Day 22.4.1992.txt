Mother Earth is a common expression for the planet earth in a number of countries and regions,
 which reflects the interdependence that exists among human beings, other living species and the planet we all inhabit.

The Earth and its ecosystems are our home. In order to achieve a just balance among the economic,
 social, and environmental needs of present and future generations,
 it is necessary to promote harmony with nature and the Earth.

International Mother Earth Day is celebrated to remind each of us that the Earth and its ecosystems provide 
us with life and sustenance.

This Day also recognizes a collective responsibility, as called for in the 1992 Rio Declaration, 
to promote harmony with nature and the Earth to achieve a just balance among the economic, 
social and environmental needs of present and future generations of humanity.

International Mother Earth Day provides an opportunity to raise public awareness around the
 world to the challenges regarding the well-being of the planet and all the life it supports.

During the commemoration of International Mother Earth Day on Monday, the Eighth Interactive Dialogue of 

the General Assembly on Harmony with Nature will be held on 23 April 2018 in the ECOSOC Chamber.
 The Interactive Dialogue will provide a platform to discuss sustainable production and consumption patterns 
in Harmony with Nature, as to ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for 
sustainable development and lifestyles in Harmony with Nature. The Dialogue also aims to inspire citizens and 
societies to reconsider how to interact with the natural world and to improve the ethical basis of the relationship
 between humankind and the Earth in the context of sustainable development.
