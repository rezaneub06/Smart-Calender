The United Nations' (UN) International Mother Language Day annually celebrates language diversity 
and variety worldwide on February 21. It also remembers events such as the killing of four students
 on February 21, 1952, because they campaigned to officially use their mother language, Bengali, in Bangladesh.
On International Mother Language Day the UN's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
and UN agencies participate in events that promote linguistic and cultural diversity. They also encourage 
people to maintain their knowledge of their mother language while learning and using more than one language.
 Governments and non-governmental organizations may use the day to announce policies to encourage language learning 
and support
