The International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation is a United Nations (UN) 
campaign held on February 6 to stop genital mutilation to girls and women.
Various activities and events are held on February 6 each year to promote the UN’s campaign to raise
 awareness and educate people about the dangers of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).
 Public conferences and forums often feature FGM survivors who are invited to share their personal experiences.
