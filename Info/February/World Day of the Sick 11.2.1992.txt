Feb. 11 is World Day of the Sick, an observation introduced by Pope John Paul II 
as a way for believers to offer prayers for those suffering from illnesses. 
The day coincides with the commemoration of Our Lady of Lourdes and is an important 
opportunity for those who serve in Catholic health ministry to reflect on caring for 
those who are sick as well as those who provide care to them.
