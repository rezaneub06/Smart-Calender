On World NGO Day we’d like to take the opportunity to thank NGOs worldwide for everything
 they do to make our world a better place. As a global health services provider, 
we’re proud to partner with NGOs to provide health benefits and services to their staff members across the globe.
Beyond providing health services, we also help facilitate knowledge exchange in the NGO sector by organising 
various events. In 2018, The Cigna Foundation and Cigna NGO Health Benefits are joining forces to organise workshops
 for NGOs on Duty of Care
