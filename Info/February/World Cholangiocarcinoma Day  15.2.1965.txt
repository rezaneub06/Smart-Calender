World Cholangiocarcinoma Day is an international effort to raise much-needed awareness 
of cholangiocarcinoma, a devastating cancer that occurs in the bile ducts in or outside 
the liver. This poorly understood and under researched disease is increasing in incidence globally - 
we believe collaboration is the way forward.
